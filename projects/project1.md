## Logic Gates (SITE1101)

This was a lab project for the SITE1101 course where our team built a set of logic-gate simulations and physical demonstrations. We focused on building accurate logic behavior and demonstrating combinations of gates.

Videos and demos are available on my YouTube channel (Daemincael).
