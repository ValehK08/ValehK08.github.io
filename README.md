# Valeh Kazimli — Portfolio (ValehK08.github.io)

This repository contains a personal portfolio website for Valeh Kazimli. The site is a single-page, responsive portfolio with sections: About, Projects, Skills, Links, and Contact.

## Contents
- `index.html` — main single-page portfolio

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named exactly `ValehK08.github.io` under your GitHub account (`ValehK08`).
2. Push these files to the repository's `main` branch (or `master`).
3. In the repository Settings → Pages, ensure the source is the `main` branch and root (`/`).
4. GitHub Pages will serve `index.html` at `https://ValehK08.github.io`.

Notes: when the repo is named `ValehK08.github.io`, the site root will load `index.html` automatically — no additional redirect is required.

## Edit content
Open `index.html` and update the About and Projects sections with new descriptions, links, or images. To add a profile photo, replace the `#avatar` div with an `<img>` tag and update `styles.css`.

If you'd like, I can:
- add a profile photo and crop it for the site,
- add animations or a dark/light toggle,
- create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy from a branch,
- or commit and push these files to your repository if you give access or run the commands locally.
