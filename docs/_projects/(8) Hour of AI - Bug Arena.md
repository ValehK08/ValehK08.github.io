# Hour of AI — Bug Arena

Project 2 was part of an Hour of AI outreach where we visited Sumgayit and taught a group of middle-school students how to participate in a "Bug Arena" coding activity. The session focused on introducing computational thinking with playful, hands-on exercises. A video summary and highlights from the event are on my YouTube channel.
