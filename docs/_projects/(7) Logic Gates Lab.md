# Logic Gates Lab — SITE1101

For Project 1 (SITE1101 lab) my teammates and I designed small combinational circuits using logic gates. We built and tested circuits on breadboards and recorded demonstration videos that show the circuits functioning and our design process. The demo videos are available on my YouTube channel (Daemincael).
